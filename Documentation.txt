Documentation for the Kit.tv app

Introduction
Kit.tv is a live streaming service, aimed to capture the once vibrant market of cat videos in a more modern internet.

Getting Stated
Installing from source my be involved, because there are some API keys that need to be put in on the operators side. In the kit.tv/kit.tv/prisma/.env file you will want to put your API keys for prisma, and ngrok, as well as your database link. From that directory you will also have to push the prisma schema. Then do a simple npm run or npm run dev and you should be up and ready to run.

Logging in
Logging in is done with Clerk and stored with Ngrok. Clerk handles all of the logging in with an email account, and vitrifaction. This can be found in the kit.tv/kit.tv/app/(auth) directory. Ngork is the tunneling service that allows us to direct the data to one server. So the login info is save to a data base running mysql.
